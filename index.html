      <h2>About Ralph</h2>
      <p>
        "Ralph is a heavy-handed wrecking' riot with a heart. For 30 years—day
        in, day out—he's been doing his job as "The Bad Guy" in the arcade game
        Fix-it Felix Jr. But it's getting harder and harder to love his job when
        no one seems to like him for doing it. Suffering from a classic case of
        Bad-Guy fatigue and hungry for a little wreck-ognition, Ralph embarks on
        a wild adventure across an incredible arcade-game universe to prove that
        just because he's a Bad Guy, it doesn't mean he's a bad guy." "Wreck-It
        Ralph is a video game character, playing the role of the villain. After
        30 years of playing the same role, Ralph felt it was time for a change.
        Ralph, along with many other video game villains, attends a council in
        an attempt to relieve the stress of being the villain of their
        respective games. Eventually, Ralph would travel to the Game Central
        Station, using the different portals to travel to various video game
        worlds. Throughout his adventure, he meets various characters, and
        accidentally unleashes an evil that can shut down the entire arcade, and
        the characters that inhabit it."
